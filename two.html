							<h1 class="major">Interest in IT</h1>
							<p>My interest in IT started all the way back when I was still in primary school. The country where I studied my primary school education didn’t have many schools with computers, so when my school bought computers and started an IT class I became very interested in them. It also influenced me to pick computer science in high school. I think IT is a very unique and broad subject with many things that can be learned. Not only is it a challenging subject, it is also constantly evolving. The most exciting thing about IT is that the future of IT is unpredictable and the possibilities are endless. I decided to pick IT as my major because of my interests in this subject and also because being able to join the IT industry could help a lot with my future. 
</p>
							<p>I picked RMIT since it is one of the best universities in Australia to study IT in. Another reason was because I’ve read that RMIT offered courses that are more practical. I think this is very helpful since it is able to better prepare the students once they graduate and get actual jobs. I hope that I will be able to learn a lot of useful skills for my future career in the 3 years at RMIT. I expect to further strengthen my skills in programming as well as learning how to cooperate and work with others better.
