							<h1 class="major">Project Ideas</h1>
							<p>Although IT is a very broad subject that covers many fields, it is still difficult to think of a solid project idea. The idea I have come up with is to develop an mobile application that provides an online marketplace for its users. The application would be primarily used for Consumer-to-consumer sales, but also have business-to-consumer. The reason why I chose this as my IT idea is because there aren’t many of these applications that support Australia. The idea of this project is to create something similar to Amazon in the states or Taobao in China. It will be able to provide a new platform for consumers creating their own things to sell or selling their second hand items and also for businesses to reach a wider audience. 
</p>
							<p>For many years, E-commerce has already been well established in Australia. However, the e-commerce sites that also provide C2C options were made many years ago, an example being ozbargains which was founded in 2011 seem to have not been updated for a while. The website is a popular choice for many people living in Australia but the UI and looks of the website are very outdated. Ozbargains also does not actually have an official application for its users that want to browse the site easily on their mobile phones. This may heavily affect the traffic that Ozbargains gets as most people would prefer to browse with their phones nowadays and may choose not to look at Ozbargains just because they do not have a mobile application, therefore creating a mobile application for an online marketplace in Australia may be a good idea. Having it made as an application can also help reach out to a wider audience as most people nowadays have smartphones and not everyone may have a laptop or computer. Creating a new platform can also be advantageous for businesses in Australia looking to expand into e-commerce since it’ll help provide more customers. 
</p>
							<p>In order to reach the widest audience possible, the application should be made for both iOS and Android. The first feature that the application will need to have is an account registration feature, this will allow users to save their details on an account for easier purchases and also to save their purchase history or bookmark specific products for sale. In order for users to actually purchase products on the application, they will need to provide details such as their name, shipping address, mobile number etc. There will also need to be an application option for businesses looking to advertise their goods on the app. The registration will require businesses to provide proof and legal information that their business is real and have no malicious intentions. Once the business has registered they will be manually processed by a person that is in charge of going through these applications to decide whether the business will be able to use the application to sell their goods. The design and layout of the application is very important to make sure that the application will not suffer the same downsides as Ozbargains where the UI is very clunky and hard to navigate. The main page for registered users should show the names and images of the most popular products being bought and also personal recommendations based upon their purchase history. Users should be able to tap on them and the app will bring them to the description page of the product, where they can read about the detailed description given by the business that is selling it along with reviews by users that have bought the product. The page should also provide a contact business option that is visible so that users can further enquire about a product that they are interested in. Another important feature that the app will need to have is a search option with many possible filters. A search option will help users browse through products they are interested in much easier and also save time. Users will also have a C2C page they can access from the home screen, where they’ll be given the option to either list an item to sell or browse items being sold by other users. Users should be able to look at the profiles of users selling an item they are looking at to look at reviews given to that user from their previous sales if they have any. There should also be a message option where users can talk with each other to discuss about an item they are interested in buying. Users should be able to report and get a refund if they’ve bought a item not according to the description or images shown by the seller given that they provide sufficient evidence. Once a user has received a product they’ve bought through the application, they should be able to provide reviews or feedback on the product they have bought. 
</p>
							<p>In order to actually create the project idea, I will need to learn how to develop mobile applications for both iOS and Android phones. Java will be used for the Android version of the application whereas Apple’s own programming language swift will be used for the iOS version. These two programming languages are the most important to develop the application but a database of some sort will also need to be created to store the information from users and businesses so SQL will also be needed to create the application. An android phone and iOS phone should be used to test the applications, however an android emulator could also be sufficient to test the Android version of the app. 
</p>
							<p>If the application is successful, a new platform will be provided to users and businesses all around Australia to market and sell their products. Users will be able to browse for products they want to buy without the hassle of searching everywhere and businesses will be able to reach a wider amount of customers. Users will also be able to sell their own items that they don’t need anymore to other users easily with the application.
