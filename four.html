							<p>These snippets show the results of two personality and a learning style test that I took online. The results of these tests are somewhat accurate in my opinion, I think that they are able to vaguely show what kind of person I am but these tests should not be used to completely judge what type of person someone is. These results could be helpful to help employers decide whether the person can be a suitable employee. The learning style test is also quite accurate since I prefer listening to people explaining something new and reading text out whenever I’m studying alone.</p>
							<p>Based on the results of these tests, I am quite the introverted person. This may affect how I work with my group mates initially. I find it difficult to adjust to new environments I get put into and also talking to strangers and people I’ve just met, but I hope I’ll be able to get to know the people I’ll need to work with better and get more comfortable around them. Once I get to know them better I’ll be able to express my opinions and thoughts easier during discussions. According to the big five personality test, I don’t think I would have any problems cooperating with most people since I have a decent score on the third factor, agreeableness.  
</p>
							<p>When forming a team the most important part is to make sure that all the group members can get work together well and get along fine. I think forming a group with someone that is more extroverted can help as well since they would be able to get the discussion started and going initially.</p>
