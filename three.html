							<p>I think the ideal job to have is one that has a competitive environment that allows every employee in it to develop their skills and abilities. The advertisement shown in the screenshots can be found here (<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38677529?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=959ed592-6658-4246-a590-5cc418e3caa3">Job Ad</a>) This advertisement is looking for a software engineer that is proficient in not only Java, but also with scripting languages such as Python and other many other programming languages. I found this job advertisement to be interesting compared to the other advertisements I’ve looked at because of the field that the company operates in. Northrop Grumman is a global defence security organisation that provides products and solutions to both governments and commercial customers all over the world. They have handled a variety of problems, both in the real world and in the cyberspace. The job provides an opportunity to be part of a world leading defence security team, which allows the employees to work alongside the best in the industry and learn from them. The job also allows for flexible working conditions, which makes it even more appealing. </p>
							<p>The most important skill that will be required as a software engineer would be coding. The job description states that in order to apply one needs to be able to code in Java, multiple scripting languages, web and interface languages and also to have an understanding of other programming languages like C++. It is also very important to be able to adjust to different styles of coding since everyone has different preferences to the way they code since the job works in a team and will most likely be reading or using other people’s code. The job does not only require knowledge of programming, but also knowledge and experience of handling Linux networking stacks and building Linux kernels. 
</p>
							<p>As of right now, I’ve only learnt Java and a bit of some other programming languages like Python. The skills and knowledge I have in programming currently are far from what is required to be eligible for the job position. I plan to acquire the skills and experience needed during my time at RMIT. I’ve taken programming classes last semester and will be able to learn more when I take the next required programming class. I will also look for resources myself that will be able to help with learning more programming and skills required to gain the skills and knowledge required for my ideal job. </p>
